## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone or download the files to your local machine**

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501)**

## 📊 Cluster Descriptions

The app uses 8 clusters to categorize Kickstarter projects:

1. **🎯 Standard Projects** - Average projects with moderate goals and typical success rates
2. **💎 Premium Projects** - High-value projects with strong backing potential
3. **🚀 High Achievers** - Projects that consistently exceed funding goals
4. **⚠️ Struggling Projects** - Projects that struggle to meet funding targets
5. **❌ Failure Projects** - Projects that typically fail to reach funding goals
6. **🌟 Emerging Stars** - New and innovative projects with growth potential
7. **🎨 Niche Projects** - Specialized projects targeting specific audiences
8. **⚖️ Balanced Projects** - Projects with mixed characteristics and moderate risk

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Source
- Kickstarter project data loaded from Google Drive
- Preprocessed with feature engineering
- Clustered using Mini-Batch KMeans algorithm

### Features Used
- `usd_goal_real`: Project funding goal
- `usd_pledged_real`: Amount pledged
- `pledge_goal_ratio`: Success ratio
- `days_duration`: Campaign duration
- Categorical features (one-hot encoded)

### Model
- **Algorithm**: Mini-Batch KMeans
- **Clusters**: 8
- **Preprocessing**: Standard scaling for numerical features

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Features
1. Modify the data loading function in `app.py`
2. Update the preprocessing pipeline
3. Retrain the model with new features
4. Update the prediction interface

### Styling
- Custom CSS is included in the app
- Modify the `<style>` section to change appearance
- Add new color schemes for different cluster types

### Cluster Labels
- Update the `get_cluster_label()` function to change cluster names
- Modify `get_cluster_description()` for new descriptions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Data Loading Error**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Google Drive file accessibility
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

2. **Model Training Issues**
   - Verify data preprocessing steps
   - Check for missing values
   - Ensure numerical columns are properly formatted

3. **Visualization Problems**
   - Update Plotly and Matplotlib versions
   - Check for data type issues
   - Verify column names match

### Performance Tips
- Use caching for data loading and model training
- Limit data size for faster processing
- Optimize visualizations for large datasets

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add more prediction features
- Implement advanced clustering algorithms
- Add export functionality for results
- Include more interactive visualizations
- Add user authentication
- Implement project recommendation system
